# Active-nematic-droplets
Requires MATLAB 2020b or newer, and PIVlab v2.55 or newer

This folder of MATLAB functions is designed for streamlined analysis of active droplets.  
Requires output from PIVlab including vector x and y magnitudes, and vorticity measurements.

Begin analysis by loading PIV output data into the MATLAB workspace.  Make sure no variables are changed!
Specify world parameters and file path in the "main" script.
Then, simply run the analysis from "main" script.
